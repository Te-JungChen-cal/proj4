    <h1>Part A: IMAGE WARPING and MOSAICING</h1>

    <div>
      <h2>1. Shoot and Digitize Pictures</h2>
      <p>
        For image warping and mosaicing, I took three pictures, one outside of
        Moffit, one inside Moffit and one in my room.
      </p>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./img/my_room1.png" alt="My Room 1" />
        <img src="./img/my_room2.png" alt="My Room 2" />
      </div>
      <div class="image-container">
        <img src="./img/out-door-1.png" alt="Outdoor 1" />
        <img src="./img/out-door-2.png" alt="Outdoor 2" />

      </div>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>2. Recover Homographies</h2>
      <p>
        To compute the entries of the homography matrix H, I set up a linear
        system of equations in the form Ah = b, where h is a vector containing
        the eight unknown entries of H. By selecting more than four
        corresponding points, I ensured that the system was overdetermined,
        which enhances stability and reduces sensitivity to noise. I then
        utilized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to solve the system, taking
        the last row of V<sup>T</sup> as the solution for h. After deriving the
        formula, I use the tool from
        <a
          href="https://cal-cs180.github.io/fa23/hw/proj3/tool.html"
          target="_blank"
          >Project 3</a
        >
        to select the points from each image.

    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>3. Image Rectification</h2>
      <p>
        To test my code, I need to perform image rectification on a photograph
        containing known rectangular objects, such as paintings or posters,
        using homography. This step ensures that my homography and warping
        functions work correctly before proceeding further.

    <div>
      <h2>4. Wrap and Blend Images into a Mosaic</h2>
      <p>
        In this process, I developed a method to create an image mosaic by
        warping multiple images to align them correctly in a common projection.
        Instead of allowing one image to overwrite another, which can result in
        noticeable edge artifacts, I employed weighted averaging to blend the
        images seamlessly. By determining the final mosaic size first, I warped
        all images into this predefined size, effectively stacking them
        together. I then applied a feathering technique to smoothly blend the
        overlapping regions of the images, allowing for a cohesive final image
        that minimizes artifacts and enhances the overall visual quality of the
        mosaic.

    <div>
      <h2>1. Harris Interest Point Detector</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented the Harris Interest Point Detector using the provided
        sample code in harris.py, focusing on identifying corner point points at
        a single scale without sub-pixel accuracy. By leveraging the existing
        code, I efficiently detected Harris corners in an image and created a
        visual representation that overlays the detected corners on the original
        image to highlight the points of interest.
      </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>2. Implement Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented Adaptive Non-maximal Suppression (ANMS) to address the
        clustering of Harris interest points, which often leads to redundant
        information in feature matching. ANMS aims to evenly distribute these
        interest points across the image for more effective matching. To achieve
        a target number of interest points, I utilized a binary search approach
        to determine the optimal radius needed to filter down to this desired
        quantity. My algorithmic methods are based on the techniques described
        in the paper

    <div>
      <h2>3. Feature Descriptor extraction</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented feature descriptor extraction by focusing on axis-aligned
        8x8 patches from interest points. To ensure the descriptors are robust,
        I sampled these patches from a larger 40x40 window, which allows for a
        well-blurred descriptor. I applied bias and gain normalization to the
        extracted descriptors to enhance their effectiveness. I ignored the
        wavelet transform section of the original method. In this process, I
        sampled points from a patch of a specified radius with designated
        spacing, taking care to use a low-pass filtered image (equivalent to a
        Gaussian blur) to prevent aliasing. After sampling, I flattened and
        normalized the features to ensure they have the desired properties.

    <div>
      <h2>4. Implement Feature Matching</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented feature matching by taking a list of feature descriptors
        from multiple images and applying Lowe's ratio test to identify good
        matches. Using the k-nearest neighbor approach, I filtered matches based
        on the distance ratio between the closest and second-closest matches,
        with a default threshold of 0.75. I also calculated the average distance
        of good matches and filtered out those exceeding this average to enhance
        match quality.

      </div>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>RANSAC</h2>
      <p>
        I implemented a robust homography estimation using the 4-point RANSAC
        algorithm. The process starts by randomly sampling four unique points
        from two sets of matched keypoints, im1Points and im2Points. For each
        sample, I computed the homography matrix ùêª H that relates these points.
        After calculating the reprojection error by applying the homography to
        the original points and measuring the Euclidean distance to the
        corresponding points, I identified inliers based on a predefined error
        threshold. The algorithm iterates for a specified number of times,
        keeping track of the homography that yields the maximum number of
        inliers. Finally, I returned the best homography matrix along with the
        inlier points that were used in the estimation, ensuring a robust
        alignment of the two sets of points despite potential noise and outliers
        in the data.
